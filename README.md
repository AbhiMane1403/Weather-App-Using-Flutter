# weatherapp_starter_project

This Flutter project is a weather application designed to provide users with real-time weather information based on their current location. Leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, it fetches detailed weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. By utilizing the device's GPS capabilities, the application automatically retrieves the user's current location and displays the corresponding weather forecast.
